## Overview of the project
Our project is using a computer to change the inputted sound, from like a guitar, run that into a computer and output it into an amp. The program will act as a middle processor to alter the sound waves and lead to different sound quality and add effects, similarly to how guitar pedals would work. To achieve this, we used the JUCE libraries, which helped us with the audio processing.

## Installation and setup
This will cover how we had set this program up, for if you want to test it or run it yourself. This is currently based on our setups and how we got it to work.
